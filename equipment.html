<h1>Equipment in modern fencing</h1>
<body>
    <p>In the following, the types of equipment will be enumerated so that later, each one being expanded.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Protective clothing;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Grips;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Electric equipment.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Protective clothing</h2>
    <p>Most personal protective equipment for fencing is made of tough cotton or nylon. Kevlar was added to top level uniform pieces (jacket, breeches, underarm protector, lamé, and the bib of the mask) following the death of Vladimir Smirnov at the 1982 World Championships in Rome. However, Kevlar is degraded by both ultraviolet light and chlorine, which can complicate cleaning. FIE rules state that tournament wear must be made of fabric that resists a force of 800 newtons (180 lbf), and that the mask bib must resist twice that amount.</p>
    <p>The complete fencing kit includes:</p>

    <h2>Electric equipment</h2>
    <p>A set of electric fencing equipment is required to participate in electric fencing. Electric equipment in fencing varies depending on the weapon with which it is used in accordance. The main component of a set of electric equipment is the body cord. The body cord serves as the connection between a fencer and a reel of wire that is part of a system for electrically detecting that the weapon has touched the opponent. There are two types: one for épée, and one for foil and sabre.</p>
    <p>A complete set of foil electric equipment includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An electric <strong>body cord</strong>, which runs under the fencer's jacket on his/her dominant side</strong>;</li>
        <li>An electric <strong>blade;</strong></li>
        <li>A conductive <strong>lamé</strong> or <strong>electric vest</strong>;</li>
        <li>A conductive <strong>bib</strong>(often attached to the mask)</strong>;</li>
        <li>An electric <strong>mask cord</strong>, connecting the conductive bib and the lamé</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
